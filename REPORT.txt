(1) Discuss the hazards you had to deal with. For each:

 - What type of hazard was it?

 - Show an instruction sequence that exposes it

 - What solutions did you consider?

 - Which one did you pick? Why?

(2) Can your implementation handle misaligned memory references? Explain

My program can handle a misaligned PC but not all misaligned memory references. 
This is because if the pc is misaligned I use both read ports on memory and
construct the correct expression at the same time I would normally receive 
an aligned PC instruction. It is worth noting that if I have a load in the M
stage of the pipeline while the pc is misaligned this will break my implementation.

However, in the case I am trying to read a misaligned memory reference, my implementation
will not read the correct addresses, only the corresponding aligned reference.
